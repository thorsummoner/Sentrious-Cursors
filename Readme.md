Sentrious Cursors
-----------------
This is a mirror of an old set of mouse cursors named Sentrious Cursors. They are based on Starcraft Classic's in-game cursors, however they are recolored black and red and extended to support common pointer varieties. 

I love these cursors, the .ain files are windows-compatable at the very least.

I did not originally author these files, nor know their original copyright.
